            <p>This is a small car with not much bang for it's buck. They say you get what you pay for, and that couldn't be
                any more true. Overall, I give this 2 out of 5 stars, for the simple fact that it "looks cute" and I'm not
                dead from driving it yet... I purchased mine new in 2017, and as of 2020, I still have under 30,000 miles. So
                far, I've had the following issues: front and rear brakes needed to be changed rear shocks needed to be
                changed cracked engine mount battery completely died and needed to be replaced alignment needed to be fixed
                needed two new front tires due to said alignment Way too many issues if you ask me for such a "young" car.
                Definitely not worth the lower cost, it'll cost you more in the long run for repairs. I also feel a shake/jolt
                which I think could be a transmission issue... Would NOT recommend.</p>
